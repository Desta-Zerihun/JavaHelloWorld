The file extension you use with your README determines how Bitbucket parses the markup in your file. For example, Bitbucket interprets the README.md as a file that uses the Markdown language. README files with a known file extension have precedence. If you have multiple README files with different file extensions, Bitbucket takes the first file that matches a known format.

With the exception of Creole markup, Bitbucket supports the same markup in README files as it does in wiki files. This table lists the supported filename extensions and their corresponding mark up languages:
